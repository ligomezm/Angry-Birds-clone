### Functionality ###
#### Bird Selection UI ####
players can choose which bird to use in the level from a responsive UI. This adds an element of strategy to the gameplay, as different birds have different abilities that can be used to complete the level.

#### Game Mechanics ####
The game also features new mechanics when the player taps the screen or clicks the mouse. The yellow bird has a bomb mechanic that affects an area and has a visual effect, while the blue bird can throw 3 little birds that attach to enemies, go in different directions, and do not collide with each other. These new mechanics make the gameplay more varied and add more ways for the player to approach each level.

#### Score Display ####
The game features a score display on the left top corner of the screen, which gives different amounts of points for impacting either structures or enemies. This encourages players to try different strategies to score as many points as possible.

#### Limited Ammo ####
In this version of the game, the player only has 3 birds to shoot to win the level. They must destroy all the enemies by direct contact with them. This adds an element of challenge to the game and requires the player to be strategic in their use of birds.

### Changes Made ###
To implement these new features, several changes were made to the original Angry Birds game. The most notable changes are:

- The addition of a bird selection UI
- The implementation of new game mechanics for the yellow and blue birds
- The addition of a score display on the left top corner of the screen
- The limitation of the number of birds the player can use to win the level
- These changes were made to add more depth and variety to the gameplay, and to make the game more challenging and engaging for players.
